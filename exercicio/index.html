            <strong>Season One</strong>
            <p>
              Marvel's Daredevil is a live action series that follows the
              journey of attorney Matt Murdock, who in a tragic accident was
              blinded as a boy but imbued with extraordinary senses. Murdock
              sets up practice in his old neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen, New
              York where he now fights against injustice as a respected lawyer
              by day and masked vigilante at night.

            <p>
              Just when Matt thinks he is bringing order back to the city, new
              forces are rising in Hell's Kitchen. Now the Man Without Fear must
              take on a new adversary in Frank Castle and face an old flame –
              Elektra Natchios. Bigger problems emerge when Frank Castle, a man
              looking for vengeance, is reborn as the Punisher, a man who takes
              justice into his own hands in Matt's neighborhood. Meanwhile, Matt
              must balance his duty to his community as a lawyer and his
              dangerous life as the Devil of Hell's Kitchen, facing a
              life-altering choice that forces him to truly understand what it
              means to be a hero.
